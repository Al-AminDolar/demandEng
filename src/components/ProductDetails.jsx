              Screw compressor is a type of rotary compressor that compresses
              air by screw action. The most important component of the screw
              compressor is two screw-like rotating elements. The twin screw
              consists of male and female rotors that rotate in opposite
              directions while the volume between them, as well as between the
              screw and the casing, decreases. <br /> <br />
              Each meshing helical screw has a fixed, built-in pressure ratio
              that depends on the screw parameters like its length and pitch.
              For maximum efficiency, it is important that the pressure ratio is
              adapted to the working pressure required at your facility. There
              are no valves or mechanical forces in the compressor, and hence
              vibrations are minimal. Also, a specialized foundation or mounting
              system is not required because the screw compressor runs very
              smoothly. <br /> <br />
              Screw compressor or rotary screw compressor finds wide use in
              industrial units all across the country. We take immense pride in
